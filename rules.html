  Castlefall is a game that works best with 4 to 10 people divided into 2 teams, although other combinations are possible. <br>
  Start by having everyone join one room of the webapp (to all join the room 'example', you could all visit <a href="">www.bpchen.com/#example</a>). <br>
  During a round, there are some words from the word set listed publicly, and each team has a (distinct) word from the list known privately to all players on that team. <br> Assignment of players to teams is done by the webapp; you don't start out knowing who else is on your team! <br> During a round, players may communicate publicly in a freeform manner. Excessive cryptography is disallowed, as is showing another person your screen or attempting to see another person's screen. If someone asks you to repeat what you've said, do so as best you can remember. <br> At any time, a player may make a call-in. It's usually good to have an obvious signal of this, such as clapping. <br>
  Players can call in either a word or a set of people. If you call in a word, the round immediately ends. If it's the other team's word, everyone on your team wins and everyone on the other team loses; otherwise, everyone on your team loses and everyone on the other team wins. <br>
  If you call in a set of people, the round isn't immediately over; there are 45 seconds during which anyone can call in a word. (No one may call in another set of people after one has been called in.)  <br> Usually, when calling in a set of people, you and your team win if and only if the set of people called in, together with you, is your team. However, this can be modified for different numbers of people. <br>
  Here is a table of suggested call-in requirements for different numbers of people, although people should feel free to experiment or rebalance!<br>
  7 or less: team called in must be exactly correct <br>
  8: call in 2 other people, both of which must be on your team <br>
  9: call in 4 other people, 3 of which must be on your team <br>
  10: call in 3 other people, all of which must be on your team <br>

  Words can be replaced by any finite set of distinguishable objects, e.g. Dixit cards.
